I am a Lecturer in Industrial and Applied Mathematics at the University of Limerick with a wide range of interests guided by the desire to work on projects applying mathematical modelling to practical problems relevant in science and industry. I have worked on various problems including mathematical modelling of coffee extraction from ground coffee beds, process modelling of contact lens hydration to improve efficiency and mathematical modelling of drug release from oral dosage forms (tablets and capsules).  

To date my work has largely focused on modelling using differential equations applyed to a variety of mass transport processes for fluids and dissolved species in porous media . The equations that arise for transport of dissolved species may include terms describing advection, diffusion and reaction. In general these equation cannot be solved exactly but, depending on the context one of more of these underlying processes may be dominant in determining the overall behaviour. Their solution is realised by applying asymptotic methods where possible to allow model simplification and numerical methods. 

I've also worked on other projects including powder processing for continuous manufacturing of tablets giving me some experience of Design of Experiments and statistical and data-driven modelling. 

At UL, I teach courses covering introductory mathematics for computer science, advanced engineering mathematics and introductory numerical methods.
